# RainbowPuke
## Puke rainbows for CoolerMaster keyboards

The default rainbow animation is crap, this resolves it by using a proper HSV rainbow generator.

The code isn't the best, I don't write C. It's hard coded for the CoolerMaster MasterKeys Pro S, it can be changed by changing the `useDevice` constant at the top.
